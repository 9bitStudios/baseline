Baseline UI
==========

Baseline is a very basic somewhat minimal application and UI framework that will provide some initial structure to any website or web application. Baseline is fairly non-invasive because its elements are prefixed with a variable name/string that the user can customize. It can even be used with other UI frameworks such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) with minimal collision. Being a modern framework, Baseline's JavaScript components are all maintained in the latest [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) versions (currently ES6).

## Build Tools
Baseline supports a number of the common [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) driven build tools including...

* [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com)
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) 

You can use whichever one you prefer.
