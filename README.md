# Baseline UI

Baseline is a very basic somewhat minimal application and UI framework that will provide some initial structure to any website or web application. Baseline is fairly non-invasive because its elements are prefixed with a variable name/string that the user can customize. It can even be used with other UI frameworks such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) with minimal collision. Being a modern framework, Baseline's JavaScript components are all maintained in the latest [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) versions.
